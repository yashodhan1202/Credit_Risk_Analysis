# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Analysis Overview

In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. We adopted the following procedure:

1) Oversample the data using the Naive Random Oversampling and SMOTE Oversampling
2) Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids
3) Combinational approach of over and undersampling using SMOTEENN alogrithm 
4) Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier 

We had to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk
